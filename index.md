### Project1
[**Text Twist**](https://qxzhang1994.github.io/text-twist/)
This is a word game which give you 7 randow letter and you should use them to create word then check it with my database, if there,you get points. We established this project with LAMP stack based on HTML, Javascript. This is an entry-level web project for me. From this project I know many API for Javescript. And know the relation between Javascript, HTML and CSS. 


### Project2 
[**MEAN stack login system**](https://qxzhang1994.github.io/loginSystem/)
This is a simple web app with four major functions: 1) A registration system, 2) A login system, 3) A change password page, and 4) after successful login show the user all previous login times. Allow registration in two ways: password and at OAuth service github. I established this project with MEAN stack. 

## Summary
I know nothing about web before. I learnt how to code HTML, CSS, Javascript according to this course. What impressed most is when I do the second project. I spent lots of time in setup OAth service.
